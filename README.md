# vim-accents

This plugin provides abbreviations for a few words/names with accents in it.
For example, typing `Holder` will result in `H\"older` if you are editing a
`TeX/LaTeX` file, and `HÃ¶lder` otherwise. (The accented abbreviations use
digraphs to make it encoding independent.)

Currently it only has abbreviations defined for names of Mathematicians I use
often. Feel free to update the list and send me a patch.
